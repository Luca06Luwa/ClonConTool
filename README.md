# ClonConTool

<b>STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS AND SHIT WILL NOT BE 100% WORKING!</B>

A GUI tool for windows designed for generating .sng files from Clone Hero's .chart files.

ALL CODE IS CLOSED SOURCE UNTIL I GET IT WORKING TO THE POINT OF JUST OUTPUTTING THE FILE.

Credits: (if not listed here then copyright is either in the code or I wrote it myself)
- SngFileFormat by mdsitton (creator of the format and what I'm basing the codebase off of.)
- Some other projects that were open source
